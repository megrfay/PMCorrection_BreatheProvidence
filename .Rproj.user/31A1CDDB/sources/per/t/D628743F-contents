```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("http://www.uvm.edu/~rsingle/stat221/data/scripts-221.R")
dat = bookdata("ch05q08.txt")
```
Problem 1, part a
```{r}
mod <- lm(SAL ~ CGPA, data=dat)
summary(mod)
leverages <- hatvalues(mod)
leverages
crit <- 2*mean(leverages)
crit
plot(dat$CGPA, leverages)
```

I think there may be outliers at observations 12 and 13. This is based on the observations where the leverages are greater than twice the average leverage (0.13). 


Problem 1, part b
```{r}
max.extst.r <- max(abs(rstudent(mod)))

#without Bonferroni correction
max.extst.r ; abs( qt(.025,28-1))

#with Bonferroni correction 
max.extst.r ; abs( qt(.025/30,28-1))
```

Without the Bonferroni correction, we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the maximum studentized residual is an outlier. 
With the Bonferroni correction, we would accept the null hypothesis and conclude that the maximum stundentized residual is not outlier. 

Problem 1, part c
```{r}
plot(mod, which = 1)
plot(predict(mod), rstudent(mod))
```

The plot is not a random scatter but looks like a concave quadratic shape. 

```{r}
qqnorm(rstudent(mod))
qqline(rstudent(mod))
kurtosis(rstudent(mod))
```

Based on the qqplot, the distribution of the studentized residuals is fairly normal, with maybe a lighter right tail. This is supported by the kurtsosi of 2.5 which is not greater than 3 nor negative.
